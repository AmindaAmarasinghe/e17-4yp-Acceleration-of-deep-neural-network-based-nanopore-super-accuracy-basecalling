## Abstract

Nanopore sequencing is a technique that is used to real-time analyze long DNA and RNA fragments which is being rapidly adopted in genomics. Monitoring changes in an electric current passing through a protein nanopore (a nanopore is a nano-size pore or cavity) as a nucleic acid and using the resulting signals to identify specific DNA or RNA fragments are the working principles of the Nanopore sequencing. Although it can be used to get real-time data sequencing which provides immediate access to the results, There are challenges in the data processing or the computational analysis side of nanopore sequencing due to the large volume of data and, the amount of computational resources required making the current basecalling implementation that uses GPUs requires few days.

There are few areas which have related works on Nanopore sequencing.

* Data compression techniques
* Techniques related to the file format for handling nanopore data
* Machine Learning techniques

1. Impact of lossy compression of nanopore raw signal data on basecalling and consensus accuracy

This rsearch has been focused on the first area in which researchers have explored the use of lossy compression for nanopore raw data using two state-of-the-art lossy time-series compressors, and evaluate the tradeoff between compressed size and basecalling/consensus accuracy. 

According to the conclusion of the research, they have found that lossy compression with existing tools can reduce the compressed size by 35â€“50% over lossless compression with less than 0.2% percent reduction in basecalling accuracy.

2. Flexible and efcient handling of nanopore sequencing signal data with slow5tools

This research has been focused on the second topic where researchers have done a good experiment on introducing a new file format called slow5 for handling nanopore data.

3. Fast nanopore sequencing data analysis with SLOW5

    * extracting biological information from these signals allow the detection of DNA and RNA modifications
    * estimation of poly(A) tail length
    * prediction of RNA secondary structures

    basecalling :
    Basecalling is a crucial step in nanopore sequencing, where raw ion current signal data is converted into a sequence of bases. The ion current signal represents the measured changes in current as a nucleic acid molecule translocates through a nanopore. The challenge lies in accurately determining the corresponding k-mers (sequences of five bases for RNA or six bases for DNA) based on the noisy signal data. This difficulty is amplified by the presence of homopolymers, where multiple k-mers share similar ion current signal ranges.

    Early basecalling methods typically achieved an accuracy of 85% or lower. Since then, significant advancements have been made in basecalling algorithms to improve nanopore sequencing accuracy. These improvements have been a driving force in achieving over 98.3% accuracy in correctly identifying bases.

    Hidden Markov model-based basecallers, such as ONT's Metrichor and Nanocall, use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to decode the signal data in nanopore sequencing. These basecallers consider the ion current signals as observable events and the k-mers as states within the HMM.

    HMM basecallers have limitations in predicting sequences in nanopore sequencing due to their focus on short-range dependencies between k-mers. They may not account for long-range dependencies effectively. Additionally, inaccuracies in the nucleotide sequence model describing the expected current values of k-mers can introduce biases in HMM basecallers. To address these constraints, basecalling tools like Albacore, nanonetvi, DeepNano, and BasecRAWller utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) framework. This approach helps overcome the limitations of HMM basecallers by leveraging the capabilities of RNNs to capture and model both short-range and long-range dependencies in the data.
